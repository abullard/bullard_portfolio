                    Welcome, delighted to have you here! Iâ€™m <b>Austin Bullard</b>, a seasoned software engineer with
                    a BA in computer science from <i>Iowa State University</i>. My journey in software began
                    shortly after starting high school and has turned into a symbiosis of work and play.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I'm a software consultant at <i>Lean TECHniques</i>, where my dual focus is
                    contributing through others, while maintaining a high throughput of software delivery. I take great
                    pride in coaching both junior and senior developers, navigating them through the intricacies of
                    modern web development practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This will always be a brain dump so feel free to read at your leisure. I hope my documentation,
                    grounded in professionalism and driven by light hearted curiosity, adds some brightness to today!
