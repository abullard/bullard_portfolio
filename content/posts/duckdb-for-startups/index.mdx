**TL;DR:** [Duckdb](https://duckdb.org/) is stupid easy to standup and it uses SQL, so you can basically use any SQL ORM and write real good SQL, with real little protection. 
But we'll fix that in the next sprint.

You wanna install a driver for DuckDB? Easy. 
###### ðŸ’¾ Code
```bash
npm install @duckdb/node-api
```

You wanna install the actual driver so you can get into a terminal session and run one off commands? Also easy.

##### Linux
###### ðŸ’¾ Code
```bash
curl https://install.duckdb.org | sh
```
##### Windows/macOS
[Download here](https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/?version=stable&environment=cli&platform=macos&download_method=direct) and install with the proper settings (that you decide)

Once installed, start duckdb via CLI with a new filename:
###### ðŸ’¾ Code
```bash
blah
```
