I write code for a living and think too much for fun. Somewhere between writing software, overthinking philosophy, and cooking unnecessarily complex meals at 1AM, I’m trying to make sense of systems—digital, social, and deeply human. I believe most problems can be solved with curiosity, grit, and a good debugging tool. The rest? Maybe poetry. Maybe fire.

This site is a brain dump. Expect a bitter blend of technical deep dives, existential musings, dark academic ramblings, and the occasional plant-based metaphor gone wildly out of control. I don’t have all the answers (and I’m deeply suspicious of anyone who claims to), but I do like asking better questions. If you’re into untangling complexity, rethinking how we build, and quietly resisting the collapse, welcome. You’re in good company.
