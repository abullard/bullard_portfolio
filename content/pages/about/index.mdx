<AboutMeImageGridTop />

I write code for a living and think too much for fun. Somewhere between engineering software, overthinking philosophy, and cooking unnecessarily complex meals at 1AM, I’m trying to make sense of systems: digital, social, and deeply human. Most problems, I believe, can be solved with curiosity, grit, and a good debugging tool. The rest? Maybe poetry. Probably fire.

When I step away from work and thought, I return to something quieter and more real. I share my life with Diandra, my partner in all things tamed & not—alongside two cats, Filbert and Almond, and a dog named Pixel. We bake, we garden, we build a home that feels lived-in and beloved. There are slow afternoons spent with family, late nights full of games and small creative rituals, mornings where future plans unfold almost without words. These are the moments that root me, the soft, stubborn weave of loyalty, imagination, and love. They are the life I choose, again and again.

## Field Notes from the Verge

This site is a brain dump. Expect a bitter blend of technical deep dives, existential musings, classical-logic-fueled ramblings, and the occasional plant-based metaphor gone wildly out of control. I don't have all the answers (and I'm deeply suspicious of anyone who claims to), but I do like asking better questions. If you're drawn to untangling complexity, reshaping how you think, and quietly resisting the slow unraveling of the systems meant to hold us, welcome. You're in good company.
